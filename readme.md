# Practice Sets 01

This C# solution is designed to explore and implement various conditional statements, such as if, else, switch, and ternary operators. It includes multiple console applications, each dedicated to a specific aspect of conditional logic, like evaluating numeric ranges, determining boolean outcomes, and handling multiple conditions. This project serves as a hands-on learning resource for understanding and mastering the use of conditional statements in C# programming.

## Activities
- PS 01.1 Write an if statement to check if a number is even. If it is even, display the message "The number [number] is even."
- PS 01.2 Write an if-else statement to determine if a number is positive or negative. If the number is positive, display the message "The number [number] is positive." Otherwise, display the message "The number [number] is negative."
- PS 01.3 Write an else-if ladder to categorize a person based on their age and monthly income.
- PS 01.4 Write a C# program using a ternary operator to determine if a student has passed or failed exam. The passing score is 50. Print "Passed" if the score is 50 or above, otherwise print "Failed".
- PS 01.5 Create a program that allows the user to choose between computing the area or the perimeter of a circle. The user will be prompted to enter the radius of the circle. Based on the user's letter choice ['A','P', or 'X'], the program will compute and display the result.

## Run specific console application

In Visual Studio, if you want to run a specific project within a solution (like PositiveNegative) instead of the default startup project (e.g., PracticeSets01):

1. Right-click the PositiveNegative Project:

- In Solution Explorer, right-click on the PositiveNegative project.

2. Select Debug > Start New Instance:

- Choose Debug from the context menu, then click on Start New Instance. This will run the PositiveNegative project without changing the startup project of the solution.
